Take a potato and cut it to french fry shaped pieces.
Put the fries into cold water.
Make sure that you take the frys out and really dry them out before you put it into the oil
Set the oil to about 270 degrees and put the frys in there for about 5 minutes
Take it out and let the fries cool completely
Then set the oil to 350 degrees and put the fries in for 5 to 6 minutes 
Take them out and then enjoy them. :)
